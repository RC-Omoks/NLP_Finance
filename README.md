NLP+AI+Finance
This repository showcases a collection of AI-powered Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflows, tools, and experiments tailored for financial data analysis. The goal of this project is to explore how state-of-the-art NLP techniques and AI models can be applied to financial contextsâ€”such as sentiment analysis, market forecasting, and automated portfolio insights.

Project Overview
Objective: Leverage cutting-edge NLP and AI algorithms to process, interpret, and gain actionable insights from financial text data (e.g., news articles, earnings reports, and social media).
Key Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, popular NLP libraries (SpaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers), and financial data APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance).
Features
Sentiment Analysis
Classify and analyze news headlines, blog posts, and tweets relevant to financial markets to gauge public sentiment around particular stocks or market events.

Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Identify named entities such as companies, stock tickers, and financial terms in text data for more granular analytics.

Text Classification
Label and organize financial texts (e.g., bullish vs. bearish, sector classification) using AI-driven classification models.

Time-Series Forecasting
Combine text-based signals with historical price data to predict potential market trends or volatility.

Data Visualization
Generate charts and interactive dashboards that showcase sentiment trends, correlations between text signals and stock prices, or other financial metrics.
